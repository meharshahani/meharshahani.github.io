Hey all, 
My name is Mehar Shahani. I'm a graduate student in Computer Science at Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago. 
I am currently enrolled in my second semester. I want to pursue a career in Software/Fullstack/Android development. 
Having completed my Bachelor's from India, I have a strong hold in languages like Java, Python, Javascript, HTML and 
have also worked with SQL, MongoDB, AWS, CSS. I am really excited for this opportunity and am happy to work in a wonderful 
team like this.
